1. in OVONIOparser.py had to remove "import dotenv" (part of your env settings?)
2. need to run "localhost" not (your ip?) http://10.0.0.218:8242/
	I put-> serviceAddress: "http://localhost:8242/" in the mgr.js file
3. The line:
	CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "*"}})
   is different than what I use in my pythonanywhere, but good news this works
   fine on my machine. No CORS problem.
4. In sbSpeech.js:155&156 the === fails because v is a string from localstorage
   and not an integer. I changed it back. 
5. Messages sent from assistants should have schema also:
	schema: { "version": "0.9.0", "url": "not_published_yet" }
6. Dress up the logs e.g.
	a. use "lightColor" for panel under the corresponding log section
	b. in fullDialog mode show "human", "wizard", etc (not "browser")
	c. title the page with the convoID, date, etc.
7. Continue with the "voices" page e.g.
	a. make the "sample phrase box longer
	b. save that phrase to localstorage so it persists
	c. speak it on selection
	d. persist the selected TTS full name & index (until next select)
	e. drop down filter to show voices of one language
	f. persist one choice so that I can pick another and compare
	g. saving msg.volume=0-1,msg.rate=0.1-10,msg.pitch=0-2 values?

8. I think we need to impliment gitignore on a lot of the runtime/support files. (e.g. .pyc files) (i added some too)

9. Next week we will do a run thru of the sandbox for the 430 group. We will show the local http server the "model" python server (for local use and on pythonanywhere.

10. I think we should put the assistant json array in a file and read it into the assistantMgr.js so that it is easier to update.

11. We should meet briefly to see where we stand on our generic drop-down component, getting "root"directories on the python-server-side, generic file "write" functionality, any more thoughts on dynamic json viewers.

12. Need to get smarter with the "loadLangSelect" function for the tts name select. (I am testing with Chrome and it has about 21 voices, some UK etc.) Looks like Safari might to ASR as well as TTS also. It would be nice if people could use Chrome, Edge, and Safari. Firefox & Opera seem to have TTS (perhaps ASR soon??)

13. Going to sbVoices on Edge (sometimes) and Chrome (always) the drop down for voices to select does not appear on the page and it does not hit the loadVoiceSelect() function.

14. Unexpected TTS voices is happening because MS has renumbered them (again!). We need to store the voice "name" in the assistant table and look through the voices array to find it and set the index whenever we load an assistant.
