Goodbye: The person is done Communicating (e.g. “I’m done here”, “bye”, etc.).
Greeting: The person is attempting to greet or introduce themselves ( e.g. “hello”, “how are you”, etc.).
Return: The person wants to go back to a previous conversational partner (e.g. “let’s go back to Cassandra”). Note, if the phrase contains the name of that partner then report the following also: [[assistantName=“the_partner_name_detected”]].
Discover: The person is trying to discover a specialized assistant to provide help on a specific topic (e.g. “I need to buy a special light bulb”, “what do I need to make brownies”, etc.). Note, if you can determine the domain of the specific topic then report that as: [[domain=”the_specific_domain”]].
