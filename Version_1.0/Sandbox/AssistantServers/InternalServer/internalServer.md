### Overview

__A JavaScript implementation of an assistant using the OVON Envlopes:__
* Text and Speech based (like all the standard assistants)
* All the logic for assistant behavior is JavaScript running in the browser environment
* In the code it has examples of parsing and building __Envelopes__
* Beyond this it permits the use of your personal OpenAI key to make an LLM based assistant _Note: You must provide your own key to an OpenAI account. It is only sent to the openAI API and remains in your personal browser localstorage. You can set this keyValue on the "settings" page_
* The pre-built "Discovery" assistant uses this functionality
