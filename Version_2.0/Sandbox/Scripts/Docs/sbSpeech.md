The sbSpeech.js file implements a speech recognition and synthesis functionality along with the ability to process other events and manage dialogue with an assistant. It uses browser APIs for speech recognition and synthesis, stores information in local storage, and includes functions for cleaning punctuation and shortening strings.

Functions:

sbStartASR(): Initiates speech recognition and starts capturing speech input, then processes and sends the input to the assistant. It also handles the visualization of the microphone icon.

cleanOutPunctuation(str): Removes punctuation from the given string.
sbSpeak(say, assistantObject): Uses speech synthesis to speak the provided text using the specified assistant object, handling different browsers and assistant configurations. It also processes the end event of speech synthesis to post any further events.

isOnVoicesPage(): Checks if the current page is sbVoices.html.
processOtherEvents(eventArray, assistantObject, thisSay): Processes other events based on the event array and the assistant object, to build and send appropriate messages to the client.

Questions:

How does the sbSpeech.js file handle different browsers for speech synthesis and recognition?
Can the speech recognition functionality be enabled or disabled based on user preference?
What is the purpose of the processOtherEvents() function and how is it triggered?
Why are punctuation marks being removed from the recognized speech input in the sbStartASR() function?
Is the speech synthesis directly triggered by user input, or is it controlled by the assistant?
